__Assignment - 3__

This assignment focuses on building a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger for English using a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM). I am tasked to derive the Viterbi Algorithm, create a Hidden Markov model and implement Viterbi decoding to determine the best tag sequence on the test data and report the accuracy of the tagger.

The folder consists of A3.pdf which talks about the given assignment and the deliverables. 201_HW3.pdf is my report.
You can find the starter_code.py under Dataset folder.
The dataset used here is the WSJ, which is part of the Penn TreeBank dataset. It is split into *train*, *dev*, and *test* sections. The dataset will have to be downloaded off the internet as I do not have access to push it to Git.

You can run part2.py, part3.py and part4.py by downloading them to your system and opening them in your chosen IDE. Then type python 'file_name.py' to run the file.
