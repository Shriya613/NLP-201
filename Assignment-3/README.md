This assignment focuses on building a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger for English using a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM).

The dataset used here is the WSJ, which is part of the Penn TreeBank dataset. It is split into *train*, *dev*, and *test* sections.

Tasked to derive the Viterbi Algorithm, create a Hidden Markov model and implement Viterbi decoding to determine the best tag sequence on the test data and report the accuracy of the tagger.
