Part 1 implements unigram, bigram, and trigram language models using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) without smoothing. The models handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words by replacing tokens that occur fewer than three times with a special <UNK> token.
Run code using:

python Part1.py

For part 2 use: 

python Part2.py
